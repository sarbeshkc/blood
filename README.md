## BloodBound
Recent developments in healthcare have emphasised the need for efficient blood
donation systems due to the logistical challenges faced by traditional methods.
The BloodBound project aims to create a system where blood donors can book
appointments at nearby medical centres and individuals in need of blood can
request donations within their vicinity. This project addresses the critical issue of
matching blood donors with recipients efficiently, reducing delays that could
potentially cost lives. Utilising C++ with the Qt framework for the front-end and
SQL for the database, Blood-Bound ensures a seamless and reliable user
experience. The expected outcome is a user-friendly application that enhances the
coordination between blood donors and medical centres, improving the efficiency
and reliability of the blood donation process. Ultimately, Blood-Bound seeks to
make blood donation more accessible and organised, thereby saving lives. It is
recommended that the system be implemented across various medical centres to
maximise its impact.
